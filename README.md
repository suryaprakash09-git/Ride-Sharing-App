# Ride-Sharing-App
This Java program simulates a ride-sharing system with an abstract Ride class and subclasses BikeRide and CarRide. It takes ride type and distance as input, validates them, calculates fare based on distance, and displays driver, vehicle, distance, and fare. Custom exceptions handle invalid rides or distances.
